## What Was Fixed:

### 1. **Submodule Issue** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** The `backend/blockchain_service` directory had a nested `.git` folder, making it a git submodule instead of a regular directory.

**Solution:**
- Removed the nested `.git` folder
- Removed the incorrectly tracked submodule reference
- Re-added the directory with all its files properly

### 2. **Cleaned Up Repository** ‚úÖ
**Added:**
- `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
- Removed all `__pycache__` directories from tracking
- Proper Python project structure

### 3. **Successfully Pushed** ‚úÖ
All your files are now on GitHub:
- ‚úÖ All documentation files (9 markdown files)
- ‚úÖ All backend services (gateway, NLP, SIEM, reporting, blockchain)
- ‚úÖ Frontend files
- ‚úÖ Docker configuration
- ‚úÖ PowerShell startup script
