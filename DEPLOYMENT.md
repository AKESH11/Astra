   - Click "Save"

4. **Your site will be live at:**
```
https://akesh11.github.io/Astra/
```

**Note:** For the backend to work, you'll need to deploy it separately (see Backend Deployment below)

## üîß Backend Deployment (Required for Full Functionality)

Your frontend needs the backend services to work. Here are options:

### Option 1: Local Backend (For Demo)
Keep your backend running locally and demo from your laptop.

### Option 2: Deploy Backend to Cloud

#### A. **Railway.app** (Recommended - Free tier)
1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create new project
4. Deploy each service separately or use Docker
5. Update `API_URL` in your frontend with the deployed URL

#### B. **Render.com** (Free tier)
1. Go to https://render.com/
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create web services for each microservice
4. Update frontend API_URL

#### C. **Heroku** (Has free tier)
1. Deploy each service as a separate Heroku app
2. Update frontend API_URL

#### D. **DigitalOcean/AWS/Azure** (Paid but professional)
- Use Docker Compose
- Deploy all services together
- Most scalable option

---

## üìù Important: Update API URL

After deploying your backend, update the `API_URL` in your frontend:

**File:** `index.html` (line ~88)

```javascript
const API_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
    ? 'http://localhost:8000'
    : 'https://your-actual-backend-url.com'; // <-- Update this!
```

---

## üéØ For Demo/Competition

### Quick Option (Recommended):
1. **Deploy frontend** to GitHub Pages/Netlify (takes 2 minutes)
2. **Run backend locally** during your demo
3. Share the live frontend link: "Check out our UI at [your-url]"
4. For the actual demo, show it working with your local backend

### Professional Option:
1. **Deploy both** frontend and backend to cloud
2. Share fully working live demo URL
3. More impressive but takes more time to set up

---

## üîó Your Deployment URLs

Once deployed, update this section:

- **Frontend (Live UI):** https://akesh11.github.io/Astra/
- **Backend (API):** (run locally or deploy to Railway/Render)
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/AKESH11/Astra

---

## ‚ö° Quick Deploy Now (GitHub Pages)

Run these commands:

```bash
# Make sure you're on gh-pages branch
git checkout gh-pages

# Commit any changes
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy frontend to GitHub Pages"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin gh-pages
```

Then enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings!

---

## üé• For Your Demo Video

You can use either:
1. **Local version** - `file:///path/to/frontend/index.html` (with services running)
2. **Deployed version** - `https://akesh11.github.io/Astra/` (looks more professional!)

---

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [ ] Frontend deployed to GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel
- [ ] Backend services accessible (local or deployed)
- [ ] API_URL updated in frontend
- [ ] Test that frontend can connect to backend
- [ ] Share live URL in your README
- [ ] Add live demo link to your presentation

---

## üí° Pro Tip

For the competition, you can:
1. Deploy frontend (looks professional with a real URL)
2. Demo with local backend (easier, no cloud setup needed)
3. Mention "Backend can be deployed to Railway/AWS/Azure for production"

This shows both that it works AND that you understand deployment architecture!

Good luck with your deployment! üöÄ
