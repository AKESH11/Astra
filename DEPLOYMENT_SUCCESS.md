## üöÄ How to Use Your Deployed Frontend

### Option 1: Demo with Local Backend (Recommended for now)

1. **Start your backend services locally:**
   ```powershell
   # Terminal 1 - Gateway
   python backend/gateway/main.py
   
   # Terminal 2 - NLP Service
   python backend/nlp_service/main.py
   
   # Terminal 3 - SIEM Service
   python backend/siem_service/main_local.py
   
   # Terminal 4 - Reporting Service
   python backend/reporting_service/main_local.py
   
   # Terminal 5 - Blockchain Service
   python backend/blockchain_service/main_local.py
   ```

2. **Open your deployed frontend:**
   ```
   https://akesh11.github.io/Astra/
   ```

3. **It will automatically connect to your local backend** (localhost:8000)

### Option 2: Full Cloud Deployment (More Advanced)

If you want both frontend AND backend in the cloud:

1. **Deploy backend to Railway.app:**
   - Sign up at https://railway.app/
   - Deploy your backend services
   - Get your backend URL (e.g., `https://astra-backend.railway.app`)

2. **Update frontend API URL:**
   ```javascript
   // In index.html (line ~90)
   const API_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
       ? 'http://localhost:8000'
       : 'https://astra-backend.railway.app'; // <-- Your Railway URL here
   ```

3. **Commit and push the change:**
   ```powershell
   git checkout gh-pages
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Update API URL for cloud backend"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

## üé• For Your Demo/Competition

### What to Show:

1. **Live URL** - Professional!
   - "Check out our live demo at https://akesh11.github.io/Astra/"
   - Shows you know deployment/hosting

2. **Backend Architecture**
   - "Backend consists of 5 microservices..."
   - Can run locally or be deployed to cloud

3. **Demo Flow:**
   - Open the live URL
   - Run backend locally during demo
   - Show the AI analysis features
   - Explain the architecture

### What to Say:

> "We've deployed ASTRA with a modern microservices architecture. The frontend is hosted on GitHub Pages for high availability, and the backend can be deployed to any cloud platform like Railway, AWS, or Azure. For today's demo, we're running the backend locally, but it's production-ready and can scale horizontally."

This shows you understand:
- ‚úÖ Deployment
- ‚úÖ Cloud hosting
- ‚úÖ Microservices
- ‚úÖ Scalability
