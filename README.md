Built with ❤️ for the cybersecurity community

</div> It empowers security analysts to detect, investigate, and report on threats faster and more efficiently than ever before.

🚀 Key Innovations & Features
Conversational Interface: Analysts use plain English to query logs and investigate threats, eliminating the need for complex query languages like KQL.

AI-Powered Narrative Generation: ASTRA doesn't just show logs; it analyzes them and presents a human-readable "attack narrative," explaining the sequence of events.

Proactive Threat Hunting: One-click modules to hunt for common, complex threats like ransomware or data exfiltration.

Immutable Audit Trail: Every action taken by an analyst via ASTRA is recorded on a private blockchain, creating a tamper-proof, legally defensible chain of custody for forensic analysis.

Automated Reporting: Instantly generate professional incident reports from investigation findings.

🏛️ System Architecture
ASTRA is built on a modern, scalable microservices architecture. This design separates concerns, improves fault tolerance, and allows for independent development and scaling of each component.

Frontend: A responsive React.js single-page application providing the core chat interface.

API Gateway: A FastAPI service that serves as the single entry point for the frontend, routing requests to the appropriate backend service.

NLP Service: The "brain" of ASTRA. It interprets user commands and summarizes log data into narratives.

SIEM Service: Connects to the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system (e.g., Elasticsearch) to fetch log data.

Reporting Service: Generates PDF incident reports.

Blockchain Service: Manages the immutable ledger for the audit trail.

🛠️ How to Run the Project
This project is fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, allowing you to run the entire distributed system with a single command.

Prerequisites
Docker installed on your machine.

An IDE like Visual Studio Code.

Steps
Clone the Repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>

Structure Your Project:
Ensure your project directory is structured exactly as provided in the file generation (with frontend, backend, docker-compose.yml, etc.). Crucially, create a Dockerfile inside each of the 5 backend service directories (gateway, nlp_service, etc.) by copying the content from backend/service.Dockerfile.

Build and Run:
Open a terminal in the root directory of the project (where docker-compose.yml is located) and run:

docker-compose up --build

This command will build the Docker images for each service and start them.

Access ASTRA:

Frontend: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port you configure for the frontend). Note: The provided HTML file can be opened directly in the browser for a quick preview without a dev server.

Backend API: The gateway is available at http://localhost:8000. You can access its interactive documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs.

🎤 Demo Script
Open the ASTRA UI.

Show the pre-built hunting modules. Click on one to populate the input.

Type a simple query: "Show me all failed logins in the last hour."

ASTRA will return a summary and key logs. Point out the AI summary.

Follow up with an investigation: "Summarize the attack narrative for IP 18.217.145.98".

Showcase the powerful AI storytelling that explains the full attack sequence.

Finish by generating a report: "Generate an incident report for this activity."

Highlight the blockchain transaction hash in the final response, explaining that the entire investigation is now securely and immutably logged.
